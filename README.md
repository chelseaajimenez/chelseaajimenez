# Hiya! I'm Chelsea Jimenez  

## About Me  
I began my career in education, supporting preschool-aged children in underserved communities as a **Jumpstart AmeriCorps** member. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted systemic gaps in educational resources, sparking my interest in **data-driven solutions** beyond direct service.

This curiosity led me to **research**, where I worked in **UC Berkeley’s Language and Cognitive Development Lab**, analyzing how pandemic stressors influenced caregiver-child interactions. Using R for linguistic analysis.

Alongside research, I worked as an Intervention Specialist, applying **data-driven strategies** to support students with learning disabilities, reinforcing my belief in **data’s power to drive informed decision-making**.

Now, as a **Master’s student in Computational Social Science at UC Berkeley**, I’m refining my skills in **Python, R, SQL, causal inference, and machine learning** to analyze complex social issues. With a background in education, psychology, and research, I aim to leverage data science to inform policy, improve interventions, and drive meaningful change.
